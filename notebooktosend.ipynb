    " # Introduction to Quantum Networking\n",
    "\n",
    " Welcome to the fascinating world of **Quantum Networking**!\n",
    "\n",
    " In this interactive notebook, you'll learn the fundamentals of quantum communication protocols and get hands-on experience with quantum key distribution, entanglement, and quantum network simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    " ## What is Quantum Networking?\n",
    "\n",
    " Quantum networking leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to create ultra-secure communication channels. Unlike classical networks that transmit bits (0s and 1s), quantum networks transmit quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in superposition states.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Key Concepts:\n",
    " - **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**: Secure key sharing using quantum mechanics\n",
    " - **Quantum Entanglement**: Spooky action at a distance for instant correlation\n",
    " - **BB84 Protocol**: A pioneering quantum cryptography protocol\n",
    " - **Quantum Channels**: The medium for transmitting qubits\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Learning Objectives:\n",
    " By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    " 1. Understand quantum networking fundamentals\n",
    " 2. Implement quantum protocols from scratch\n",
    " 3. Interact with a live quantum network simulation\n",
    " 4. Write your own quantum host implementations\n",
    " 5. Analyze quantum security and error rates\n",
    "\n",
    " Let's begin this quantum journey!"

    "\n",
    " A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information. Unlike classical bits that are either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a **superposition** of both states:\n",
    "\n",
    " $$|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle$$\n",

    "\n",
    " The BB84 protocol is a quantum key distribution protocol that allows two parties (Alice and Bob) to share a secret key using quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Key Steps:\n",
    " 1. **Alice** prepares qubits in random bases (Z or X)\n",
    " 2. **Alice** sends qubits to Bob through a quantum channel\n",
    " 3. **Bob** measures qubits in random bases\n",
    " 4. **Alice and Bob** publicly compare their basis choices\n",
    " 5. **Alice and Bob** keep only the bits where bases matched\n",
    " 6. **Alice and Bob** estimate error rate and perform privacy amplification\n",
