# Protocol Switching Fix - Summary

## What Was Wrong

You were seeing **B92 logs** when you wanted **BB84 logs** because:
- ✗ Both `student_implementation_status.json` (BB84) and `student_b92_implementation_status.json` (B92) were active
- ✗ The backend was detecting B92 instead of BB84
- ✗ Protocol switching wasn't properly disabling the inactive protocol

## What Was Fixed

✓ **Created automated switching scripts** (`switch_to_bb84.py` and `switch_to_b92.py`)  
✓ **Disabled B92** by renaming to `.disabled`  
✓ **Ensured only BB84 is active**  
✓ **Restarted Docker backend** to apply changes  
✓ **Created comprehensive guide** (PROTOCOL_SWITCHING_GUIDE.md)

## Current Status

```
Active Protocol: BB84 ✓
BB84 file: student_implementation_status.json (ACTIVE)
B92 file: student_b92_implementation_status.json.disabled (DISABLED)
```

## How to Use Going Forward

### Running BB84 Protocol
```bash
python switch_to_bb84.py
docker-compose restart
```
Then run your notebook - you'll see **BB84 logs**!

### Running B92 Protocol
```bash
python switch_to_b92.py
docker-compose restart
```
Then run your notebook - you'll see **B92 logs**!

## Key Files You Have Now

1. **`switch_to_bb84.py`** - One-command switch to BB84
2. **`switch_to_b92.py`** - One-command switch to B92
3. **`PROTOCOL_SWITCHING_GUIDE.md`** - Complete documentation
4. **`protocol_detection_utils.py`** - Backend protocol detection (already existed)
5. **`protocol_helpers.py`** - Notebook helper functions (already existed)

## Understanding Protocol Detection

**Both files work together:**

1. **`protocol_detection_utils.py`** 
   - Used by backend/server
   - Detects which protocol based on status files
   - Priority: BB84 first, then B92 if not disabled

2. **`protocol_helpers.py`**
   - Used by notebook cells
   - Helper functions: `switch_to_bb84()`, `switch_to_b92()`, `check_current_protocol()`
   - Creates/updates status files

## Important Rules

1. **Only ONE protocol can be active at a time**
2. **Always restart Docker after switching**: `docker-compose restart`
3. **Use the switch scripts** - they handle everything correctly
4. **Don't manually edit status files** - use the scripts

## Verification

Check your current protocol anytime:
```bash
python -c "from protocol_detection_utils import detect_active_protocol; print('Active:', detect_active_protocol())"
```

## Your Implementation Files

Make sure these exist:
- ✓ `student_bb84_impl.py` - Your BB84 code (StudentQuantumHost class)
- ✓ `student_b92_impl.py` - Your B92 code (StudentB92Host class)
- ✓ `enhanced_student_bridge.py` - BB84 bridge
- ✓ `enhanced_student_bridge_b92.py` - B92 bridge

## Testing It Works

1. Current state: **BB84 is active**
2. Run your notebook simulation
3. You should see logs like:
   - "STUDENT BB84: Starting with X qubits"
   - "BB84 protocol detected"
   - BB84-specific messages

4. To test B92:
   ```bash
   python switch_to_b92.py
   docker-compose restart
   ```
   Then run simulation and see B92 logs!

---

**You're all set!** The protocol switching now works correctly. You'll see BB84 logs when running BB84 and B92 logs when running B92.
