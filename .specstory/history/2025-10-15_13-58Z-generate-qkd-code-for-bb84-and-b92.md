# Generate QKD code for BB84 and B92 (2025-10-15 13:58Z)

_**User (2025-10-15 13:58Z)**_

iwill give u prompts with skeleton fucntion for bb84 and b92 qkd code , can u give me the code for it according to that so that i can copy and paste

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to provide code for BB84 and B92 quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols based on skeleton functions they will provide. They want complete implementations that they can copy and paste.

Since they haven't provided the skeleton functions yet, I should acknowledge their request and ask them to share the skeleton functions so I can provide the implementations accordingly.

Let me check what's in their current workspace to understand the context better.</details></think>

I'd be happy to help you implement the BB84 and B92 QKD protocols! 

Please share the skeleton functions you have, and I'll provide you with the complete code implementations that you can copy and paste directly.

In the meantime, let me check your current notebook to understand the structure better:

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: qsimnotebook.ipynb

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to provide complete code implementations for BB84 and B92 QKD protocols based on skeleton functions. Looking at the notebook, I can see:

1. Cell 8 contains the BB84 implementation with prompts as comments
2. Cell 16 contains the B92 implementation with prompts as comments

Both cells have prompts that describe what each method should do, and there are already implementations in place. However, the user is saying they will give me prompts with skeleton functions, which suggests they might want to start fresh or they want me to provide clean, ready-to-copy implementations based on the prompts I can see.

Let me prepare clean, complete implementations for both BB84 and B92 based on the prompts I can see in the notebook. I'll make them ready to copy and paste.</details></think>

I can see your notebook already has the prompts and implementations! Let me provide you with clean, complete, ready-to-copy implementations for both BB84 and B92 QKD protocols based on the prompts in your notebook.

This implementation follows all the prompts from your notebook and includes:

1. **Constructor** - Initializes all 7 required lists and prints confirmation message
2. **b92_prepare_qubit** - Maps bits to non-orthogonal states (0→|0⟩, 1→|+⟩)
3. **b92_measure_qubit** - Randomly measures in Z or X basis with correct quantum mechanics
4. **b92_sifting** - Keeps only conclusive measurements (outcome=1) and determines bits
5. **b92_send_qubits** - Generates random bits and prepares qubits
6. **b92_process_received_qbit** - Processes received qubits
7. **b92_estimate_error_rate** - Calculates error rate from sample comparisons

You can copy and paste this entire code into your notebook cell to replace the B92 implementation!

_**User (2025-10-15 13:58Z)**_

just give me code for this prompt 

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants just the code for the BB84 constructor based on the prompt they've highlighted. The prompt says:

"Create a constructor that accepts a single parameter for the host's identifier.
Store this identifier as an instance variable. Initialize five empty list attributes:
one for storing random binary values, one for preparation bases, one for encoded states,
one for measurement bases used during reception, and one for measurement results.
After initialization, print a confirmation message in the format:
"StudentQuantumHost '<identifier>' initialized successfully!"
where <identifier> is replaced with the actual value passed to the constructor."

So I need to provide just the constructor code.</details></think>

---

Here's the code for the BB84 constructor based on that prompt:

```python
def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
    self.random_bits = []
    self.measurement_bases = []
    self.quantum_states = []
    self.received_bases = []
    self.measurement_outcomes = []
    print(f"StudentQuantumHost '{self.name}' initialized successfully!")
```

This constructor:
- Accepts the host's identifier as `name`
- Stores it as `self.name`
- Initializes 5 empty lists:
  - `random_bits` - for random binary values
  - `measurement_bases` - for preparation bases
  - `quantum_states` - for encoded states
  - `received_bases` - for measurement bases during reception
  - `measurement_outcomes` - for measurement results
- Prints the confirmation message with the host's name

_**User (2025-10-15 13:58Z)**_

for this prompt and fucn only 

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants just the code for the `bb84_send_qubits` method based on the prompt provided. Let me create the implementation following the exact requirements:

1. Accept integer parameter for quantity of qubits
2. Print message indicating preparation
3. Clear and reinitialize three lists: random_bits, measurement_bases, quantum_states
4. For each qubit:
   - Generate random bit (0 or 1)
   - Generate random basis (0 or 1)
   - If basis is 0: bit 0 → "|0⟩", bit 1 → "|1⟩"
   - If basis is 1: bit 0 → "|+⟩", bit 1 → "|-⟩"
   - Append to the three lists
5. Print how many qubits were prepared
6. Return the quantum states list</details></think>

---

Here's the code for the `bb84_send_qubits` method based on that prompt:

```python
def bb84_send_qubits(self, num_qubits):
    print(f"{self.name} is preparing {num_qubits} qubits...")
    self.random_bits = []
    self.measurement_bases = []
    self.quantum_states = []
    
    for _ in range(num_qubits):
        bit = random.randint(0, 1)
        basis = random.randint(0, 1)
        
        if basis == 0:
            state = "|0⟩" if bit == 0 else "|1⟩"
        else:
            state = "|+⟩" if bit == 0 else "|-⟩"
        
        self.random_bits.append(bit)
        self.measurement_bases.append(basis)
        self.quantum_states.append(state)
    
    print(f"{self.name} prepared {len(self.quantum_states)} qubits")
    return self.quantum_states
```

This method:
- Prints preparation message with qubit count
- Clears and reinitializes the 3 lists
- Generates random bit and basis for each qubit
- Encodes in Z basis (0) as |0⟩/|1⟩ or X basis (1) as |+⟩/|-⟩
- Appends to all three lists
- Prints completion message
- Returns the quantum states list

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants the code for the `process_received_qbit` method based on the prompt provided.

Based on the prompt:
1. Accept two parameters: quantum state string and channel reference
2. Generate random measurement basis (0 or 1) and append to received_bases
3. Perform measurement:
   - If basis is 0 (rectilinear/Z basis):
     * |0⟩ → 0
     * |1⟩ → 1
     * |+⟩ or |-⟩ → random (0 or 1)
   - If basis is 1 (diagonal/X basis):
     * |+⟩ → 0
     * |-⟩ → 1
     * |0⟩ or |1⟩ → random (0 or 1)
   - Any other state → random
4. Append outcome to measurement_outcomes
5. Return True</details></think>

Here's the code for the `process_received_qbit` method based on that prompt:

```python
def process_received_qbit(self, qbit, from_channel):
    basis = random.randint(0, 1)
    self.received_bases.append(basis)
    
    if basis == 0:  # Rectilinear (Z) basis
        if qbit == "|0⟩":
            outcome = 0
        elif qbit == "|1⟩":
            outcome = 1
        elif qbit == "|+⟩" or qbit == "|-⟩":
            outcome = random.randint(0, 1)
        else:
            outcome = random.randint(0, 1)
    else:  # Diagonal (X) basis
        if qbit == "|+⟩":
            outcome = 0
        elif qbit == "|-⟩":
            outcome = 1
        elif qbit == "|0⟩" or qbit == "|1⟩":
            outcome = random.randint(0, 1)
        else:
            outcome = random.randint(0, 1)
    
    self.measurement_outcomes.append(outcome)
    return True
```

This method:
- Generates random measurement basis (0 or 1)
- Appends basis to `received_bases` list
- Measures in Z basis (0): |0⟩→0, |1⟩→1, |+⟩/|-⟩→random
- Measures in X basis (1): |+⟩→0, |-⟩→1, |0⟩/|1⟩→random
- Appends outcome to `measurement_outcomes` list
- Returns True

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants the code for the `bb84_reconcile_bases` method based on the prompt provided. Let me break down what the prompt asks for:

1. Accept two parameters: alice_bases and bob_bases (lists of basis values)
2. Print a message indicating comparing basis choices
3. Create two empty lists: matching_indices and corresponding_bits
4. Iterate through both basis lists with enumeration
5. When bases are equal at an index:
   - Append index to matching_indices
   - If index is valid for measurement_outcomes, append that value to bits list
   - Otherwise, if index is valid for random_bits, append that value to bits list
6. Calculate total comparisons as min(len(alice_bases), len(bob_bases))
7. Calculate match proportion (matches/total or 0 if total is 0)
8. Print "Matches found: X / Y (Z%)" where Z has 1 decimal place
9. Return both lists

Let me write this code:</details></think>

Here's the code for the `bb84_reconcile_bases` method based on that prompt:

```python
def bb84_reconcile_bases(self, alice_bases, bob_bases):
    print(f"{self.name} is comparing basis choices...")
    matching_indices = []
    corresponding_bits = []
    
    for i, (alice_basis, bob_basis) in enumerate(zip(alice_bases, bob_bases)):

            elif i < len(self.random_bits):
                corresponding_bits.append(self.random_bits[i])
    
    total_comparisons = min(len(alice_bases), len(bob_bases))
    matches_found = len(matching_indices)
    match_proportion = matches_found / total_comparisons if total_comparisons > 0 else 0
    
    print(f"Matches found: {matches_found} / {total_comparisons} ({match_proportion*100:.1f}%)")
    return matching_indices, corresponding_bits
```

This method:
- Prints comparison message
- Creates two empty lists for indices and bits
- Iterates through both basis lists with enumeration
- When bases match, appends index and corresponding bit (from measurement_outcomes or random_bits)
- Calculates total comparisons and match proportion
- Prints matches in format "X / Y (Z%)" with 1 decimal
- Returns both lists

The error shows there's a syntax error in `student_bb84_impl.py` at line 151-152: `expected an indented block after 'for' statement`. This means there's a `for` loop without any code inside it.

Let me check the current implementation file to see what's wrong:

_**User (2025-10-15 13:58Z)**_

is this correct

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me check the file carefully for errors:

1. Lines 152-157: The `if alice_basis == bob_basis:` block is correct, but lines 154-157 should be inside the `if alice_basis == bob_basis:` block, not outside! Currently:
```python
for i, (alice_basis, bob_basis) in enumerate(zip(alice_bases, bob_bases)):
    if alice_basis == bob_basis:
        matching_indices.append(i)
    if i < len(self.measurement_outcomes):  # This should be indented more!
        corresponding_bits.append(self.measurement_outcomes[i])
    elif i < len(self.random_bits):
        corresponding_bits.append(self.random_bits[i])
```

This is wrong! Lines 154-157 should only execute when bases match.

2. Lines 192-199: There's a syntax error here. Line 192 has `if position < len(self.measurement_outcomes):` and line 193 increments comparison_count, but then line 194 checks if values don't match - but line 196 has `elif position < len(self.random_bits):` which is at the wrong indentation level and will cause a syntax error because the `elif` doesn't have a matching `if` at that level.

Current code:
```python
for position, reference_bit in zip(sample_positions, reference_bits):
    if position < len(self.measurement_outcomes):
        comparison_count += 1
    if self.measurement_outcomes[position] != reference_bit:  # This if should be indented!
        error_count += 1
elif position < len(self.random_bits):  # This elif has no matching if!
```

This is definitely wrong.</details></think>

---

**No, this code still has errors!** There are two problems:

## Problem 1: Lines 152-157 (bb84_reconcile_bases)
Lines 154-157 should be **inside** the `if alice_basis == bob_basis:` block. Currently, they're adding bits for ALL positions, not just matching ones.

**Current (WRONG):**
```python
for i, (alice_basis, bob_basis) in enumerate(zip(alice_bases, bob_bases)):
    if alice_basis == bob_basis:
        matching_indices.append(i)
    if i < len(self.measurement_outcomes):  # ❌ Wrong indentation!
        corresponding_bits.append(self.measurement_outcomes[i])
    elif i < len(self.random_bits):
        corresponding_bits.append(self.random_bits[i])
```

## Problem 2: Lines 192-196 (bb84_estimate_error_rate)
Line 194 should be indented inside the `if` block, and line 196 `elif` will cause a syntax error.

**Current (WRONG):**
```python
for position, reference_bit in zip(sample_positions, reference_bits):
    if position < len(self.measurement_outcomes):
        comparison_count += 1
    if self.measurement_outcomes[position] != reference_bit:  # ❌ Wrong indentation!
        error_count += 1
elif position < len(self.random_bits):  # ❌ SYNTAX ERROR - elif has no matching if
```

---

## **Here's the CORRECTED code for those two methods:**

Replace lines 146-164 with:
```python
def bb84_reconcile_bases(self, alice_bases, bob_bases):
    print(f"{self.name} is comparing basis choices...")
    matching_indices = []
    corresponding_bits = []
    
    for i, (alice_basis, bob_basis) in enumerate(zip(alice_bases, bob_bases)):
        if alice_basis == bob_basis:
            matching_indices.append(i)
            if i < len(self.measurement_outcomes):
                corresponding_bits.append(self.measurement_outcomes[i])
            elif i < len(self.random_bits):
                corresponding_bits.append(self.random_bits[i])
    
    total_comparisons = min(len(alice_bases), len(bob_bases))
    matches_found = len(matching_indices)
    match_proportion = matches_found / total_comparisons if total_comparisons > 0 else 0
    
    print(f"Matches found: {matches_found} / {total_comparisons} ({match_proportion*100:.1f}%)")
    return matching_indices, corresponding_bits
```

Replace lines 186-203 with:
```python
def bb84_estimate_error_rate(self, sample_positions, reference_bits):
    print(f"{self.name} is calculating error rate...")
    comparison_count = 0
    error_count = 0
    
    for position, reference_bit in zip(sample_positions, reference_bits):
        if position < len(self.measurement_outcomes):
            comparison_count += 1
            if self.measurement_outcomes[position] != reference_bit:
                error_count += 1
        elif position < len(self.random_bits):
            comparison_count += 1
            if self.random_bits[position] != reference_bit:
                error_count += 1
    
    error_rate = error_count / comparison_count if comparison_count > 0 else 0.0
    print(f"Error rate: {error_rate*100:.2f}% ({error_count}/{comparison_count})")
    return error_rate
```

The key fixes:
- **Line 154-157**: Need to be indented 4 more spaces (inside the `if alice_basis == bob_basis:`)
- **Line 194**: Need to be indented 4 more spaces (inside the `if position < len(...)`)
- **Line 196**: The `elif` needs to be at the same level as the first `if` in the for loop

There's still an error! Line 196 has `elif position < len(self.random_bits):` which is inside the first `if` block, but it should be at the same level as the first `if`. And line 198-199 are wrong - they're executing for every iteration regardless.

The correct structure should be:
```python
for position, reference_bit in zip(sample_positions, reference_bits):
    if position < len(self.measurement_outcomes):
        comparison_count += 1
        if self.measurement_outcomes[position] != reference_bit:
            error_count += 1
    elif position < len(self.random_bits):  # This should be at same level as first if
        comparison_count += 1
        if self.random_bits[position] != reference_bit:  # This needs to be inside the elif
            error_count += 1
```

So no, it's still wrong.</details></think>

**No, there's still a problem in `bb84_estimate_error_rate`!**

Lines 196-199 have incorrect logic. Look at the structure:

```python
for position, reference_bit in zip(sample_positions, reference_bits):
    if position < len(self.measurement_outcomes):
        comparison_count += 1
        if self.measurement_outcomes[position] != reference_bit:
            error_count += 1
        elif position < len(self.random_bits):  # ❌ Line 196: This elif makes no sense here!
            comparison_count += 1
    if self.random_bits[position] != reference_bit:  # ❌ Line 198: This will run every time!
        error_count += 1
```

**Problems:**
1. Line 196 `elif position < len(self.random_bits):` is inside the first `if` block checking `measurement_outcomes`, so it will only execute if the position is valid for measurement_outcomes but the bit didn't match. That's wrong logic!
2. Line 198-199 will execute for EVERY position in the loop, causing errors when position is invalid for `random_bits`

---

## **CORRECT version for bb84_estimate_error_rate:**

Replace lines 186-203 with:

```python
def bb84_estimate_error_rate(self, sample_positions, reference_bits):
    print(f"{self.name} is calculating error rate...")
    comparison_count = 0
    error_count = 0
    
    for position, reference_bit in zip(sample_positions, reference_bits):
        if position < len(self.measurement_outcomes):
            comparison_count += 1
            if self.measurement_outcomes[position] != reference_bit:
                error_count += 1
        elif position < len(self.random_bits):
            comparison_count += 1
            if self.random_bits[position] != reference_bit:
                error_count += 1
    
    error_rate = error_count / comparison_count if comparison_count > 0 else 0.0
    print(f"Error rate: {error_rate*100:.2f}% ({error_count}/{comparison_count})")
    return error_rate
```

The key: `elif` should be at the **same indentation level** as the first `if`, and the `self.random_bits` check should be **inside** the `elif` block.

**Yes! ✅ This code is now CORRECT!**

All the indentation issues have been fixed:

1. ✅ **Constructor** (lines 23-30): Correct
2. ✅ **bb84_send_qubits** (lines 48-68): Correct
3. ✅ **process_received_qbit** (lines 101-125): Correct
4. ✅ **bb84_reconcile_bases** (lines 146-164): Correct - the bit appending logic is now properly inside the `if alice_basis == bob_basis:` block
5. ✅ **bb84_estimate_error_rate** (lines 186-203): Correct - the `elif` is at the proper indentation level and the random_bits check is inside the elif block

The code should work now! You can:

_**User (2025-10-15 13:58Z)**_

has this error been in notebook vibe code section for bb84 or not 

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the notebook code the user just shared, I can see there ARE errors in the notebook:

Line 145: `def bb84_reconcile_bases(self, alice_bases, bob_bases):`
This is NOT indented properly - it should be indented to be a method of the class (should have 4 spaces at the beginning).

Line 185: `def bb84_estimate_error_rate(self, sample_positions, reference_bits):`
Same issue - NOT indented properly.

These method definitions are at the module level instead of being part of the StudentQuantumHost class. They need to be indented to be class methods.

So YES, there ARE errors in the notebook BB84 section.</details></think>

---

**YES, there ARE errors in the notebook!** 

Looking at your notebook code, I can see two critical indentation errors:

**Problem 1 - Line 145:**
```python
#def bb84_reconcile_bases(self, alice_bases, bob_bases):
def bb84_reconcile_bases(self, alice_bases, bob_bases):  # ❌ NOT INDENTED!
    print(f"{self.name} is comparing basis choices...")
```

**Problem 2 - Line 185:**
```python
#def bb84_estimate_error_rate(self, sample_positions, reference_bits):
def bb84_estimate_error_rate(self, sample_positions, reference_bits):  # ❌ NOT INDENTED!
    print(f"{self.name} is calculating error rate...")
```

Both method definitions (`def bb84_reconcile_bases` and `def bb84_estimate_error_rate`) are **not indented**. They need to be indented with 4 spaces to be part of the `StudentQuantumHost` class.

---

## **Fix for the notebook:**

Change line 145 from:
```python
def bb84_reconcile_bases(self, alice_bases, bob_bases):
```

To (add 4 spaces at the start):
```python
    def bb84_reconcile_bases(self, alice_bases, bob_bases):
```

Change line 185 from:
```python
def bb84_estimate_error_rate(self, sample_positions, reference_bits):
```

To (add 4 spaces at the start):
```python
    def bb84_estimate_error_rate(self, sample_positions, reference_bits):
```

These methods need to be at the same indentation level as the other methods in the class (`__init__`, `bb84_send_qubits`, `process_received_qbit`).

can u help me write an email to py professor asking that the installation process has been automated now, (need to test) though, using a single command according to their os, and the student code from the vibe code cell will be recorded in the database along with the unique studend id  time spent to write each methods for QKD protocol for example "how long did it take them to write send_qubits", lines and characters added, line removed, the code we can look up anytime for each students, and students can directly import the chat they had with the vibe code agent that is present in the vs code , after completion , we will ask students to send the chat they had along with their student id as a part of the assignment, by looking at the database code and the chat they had , we can tell how often they used the vibe coding agent , where did they had problem . but the students need to repeat the method saving task and tracking in repetation , although its easy and just couple lines . make humannized simple looking email

**Subject:** Update on QKD Assignment - Automated Setup & Student Tracking

Hi Professor [Name],

I wanted to share some updates on the quantum key distribution assignment we've been working on.

**Installation Process**
We've automated the installation so students can now get everything set up with a single command based on their operating system. This should make it much easier for everyone to get started. I still need to test it more thoroughly, but it's looking promising!

**Student Code Tracking**
The system now automatically records student work in a database as they complete the "vibe code" sections. For each student, we're tracking:
- Their unique student ID
- Time spent writing each method (like "how long did it take to write send_qubits")
- Lines and characters added/removed
- Complete code history that we can look up anytime

**AI Agent Usage Analysis**
Students are using a vibe coding agent in VS Code to help them write the QKD protocol implementations. We can have them export their chat history with the agent and submit it along with their student ID as part of the assignment.

By comparing the database code history with their chat logs, we'll be able to see:
- How frequently they relied on the AI agent
- Which parts of the protocol they found challenging
- Their problem-solving approach

**One Small Note**
Students do need to run a couple lines repeatedly to save and track each method they write. It's simple, but I wanted to mention it since it requires them to remember to do it after completing each function.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss any of this further or if you have suggestions!

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

**Subject:** Update on QKD Assignment - Automated Setup & Tracking

Hi Professor [Name],

I wanted to give you a quick update on the quantum key distribution assignment.

**What's New:**
- **Installation:** Now automated with a single OS-specific command (still testing)
- **Code Tracking:** The system automatically records each student's work in a database, including:
  - Time spent on each method (e.g., "send_qubits")
  - Lines/characters added/removed
  - Complete code history with their student ID

**Assignment Submission:**
Students will submit their VS Code chat history (from the vibe coding agent) along with their student ID. By comparing the database logs with their chat history, we can see how often they used the AI agent and where they struggled.

**Note:** Students need to run a quick save/track command after writing each method (just a couple lines, but it's repetitive).

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!

Best,  
[Your Name]
