Resolve this merge conflict

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to resolve a merge conflict in the DOCUMENTATION.md file. Looking at the file contents, I can see there's a merge conflict marker:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
"My simulation logs are stored under "qsimnotebookfinal/simulation_logs/" can you analyze the files and answer me according to those logs.."
>>>>>>> 78e2f8ae28e1fa5ec93a6838055eba33cc0f0645
```

This appears around lines 333-336 in the "Ask the Vibe Coding Agent About Your Logs" section.

The conflict shows:
- HEAD (current branch): has no content between the conflict markers
- The other branch (78e2f8ae...): has an additional line with text about simulation logs

This seems like the other branch added a helpful example prompt that should be included. The context shows this is in a section providing example prompts for asking the AI agent about logs, so this additional line makes sense to keep.

I should resolve this by keeping the line from the incoming branch and removing the conflict markers.</details></think>

I'll resolve the merge conflict in the DOCUMENTATION.md file. Looking at the conflict, it appears that the incoming branch added a helpful example prompt about analyzing simulation logs that should be included.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! I've successfully resolved the merge conflict by keeping the line from the incoming branch and removing the conflict markers. The resolved version now includes the helpful example prompt about simulation logs, which fits naturally into the section about asking the AI agent about logs.

Let me check if there are any linter errors introduced by this change.</details></think>

Perfect! I've resolved the merge conflict in the DOCUMENTATION.md file. The conflict has been resolved by:

1. **Removing the conflict markers** (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> 78e2f8ae...`)
2. **Keeping the added content** from the incoming branch - the helpful example prompt about analyzing simulation logs

The resolved section now cleanly includes the example prompt: *"My simulation logs are stored under "qsimnotebookfinal/simulation_logs/" can you analyze the files and answer me according to those logs.."* which fits perfectly in the context of the "Ask the Vibe Coding Agent About Your Logs" section.

The merge conflict is now resolved and the file is ready to be committed.
