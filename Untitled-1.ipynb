    "  # Introduction to Quantum Networking\n",
    "\n",
    "  Welcome to the fascinating world of **Quantum Networking**!\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this interactive notebook, you'll learn the fundamentals of quantum communication protocols and get hands-on experience with quantum key distribution, entanglement, and quantum network simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## What is Quantum Networking?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Quantum networking leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to create ultra-secure communication channels. Unlike classical networks that transmit bits (0s and 1s), quantum networks transmit quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in superposition states.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Key Concepts:\n",
    "  - **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**: Secure key sharing using quantum mechanics\n",
    "  - **Quantum Entanglement**: Spooky action at a distance for instant correlation\n",
    "  - **BB84 Protocol**: A pioneering quantum cryptography protocol\n",
    "  - **Quantum Channels**: The medium for transmitting qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "  By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "  1. Understand quantum networking fundamentals\n",
    "  2. Implement quantum protocols from scratch\n",
    "  3. Interact with a live quantum network simulation\n",
    "  4. Write your own quantum host implementations\n",
    "  5. Analyze quantum security and error rates\n",
    "\n",
    "  Let's begin this quantum journey!"

    "\n",
    "  The BB84 protocol is a quantum key distribution protocol that allows two parties (Alice and Bob) to share a secret key using quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Key Steps:\n",
    "  1. **Alice** prepares qubits in random bases (Z or X)\n",
    "  2. **Alice** sends qubits to Bob through a quantum channel\n",
    "  3. **Bob** measures qubits in random bases\n",
    "  4. **Alice and Bob** publicly compare their basis choices\n",
    "  5. **Alice and Bob** keep only the bits where bases matched\n",
    "  6. **Alice and Bob** estimate error rate and perform privacy amplification\n",

    " #  The B92 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " The **B92 protocol** is a simplified version of BB84, introduced by Charles Bennett in 1992.\n",
    " Unlike BB84 which uses *four* states, B92 only uses **two non-orthogonal quantum states**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Alice sends qubits randomly chosen from two possible states (for example, `|0⟩` and `|+⟩`).\n",
    " - Bob measures each qubit using one of two bases, but since the states are not orthogonal, he sometimes gets an **inconclusive result**.\n",
    " - Only when Bob's measurement gives a *definite result* do Alice and Bob keep that bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  The key idea: by using non-orthogonal states, an eavesdropper (Eve) cannot perfectly distinguish them without disturbing the qubits  and that disturbance reveals her presence.\n"

    " #  Why B92 Works and What to Look for in the Logs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " In B92, **information is hidden in the fact that not all measurements succeed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Bob keeps only the bits where his measurement result is *certain*.\n",
    " - This means fewer key bits than BB84, but **more security checks** against eavesdropping.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " When we run the simulation:\n",
    " - You’ll see **Alice’s choices** of qubit states (randomly `|0⟩` or `|+⟩`).\n",
    " - You’ll see **Bob’s measurement results** some conclusive (bit values), some inconclusive (discarded).\n",
    " - Finally, you’ll notice that the **shared key** is formed only from the conclusive outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  Takeaway: The strength of B92 lies in the *impossibility of cloning non-orthogonal states*  making eavesdropping detectable"
