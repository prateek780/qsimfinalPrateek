        "- **Automatic Protocol Detection**: Detects which protocol you're implementing based on your code\n",

        "- **Unified Interface**: Same interface for both protocols\n",

        "- **UI Logging**: Logs are displayed in the simulation UI, not just console\n",

        "### How it works:\n",
        "1. The system analyzes your code to detect which protocol you're implementing\n",
        "2. It loads the appropriate implementation files (student_bb84_impl.py or student_b92_impl.py)\n",
        "3. It sets up the correct interactive hosts and enhanced bridges\n",
