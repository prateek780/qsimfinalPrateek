#  # Introduction to Quantum Networking
# 
#  Welcome to the fascinating world of **Quantum Networking**!
# 
#  In this interactive notebook, you'll learn the fundamentals of quantum communication protocols and get hands-on experience with quantum key distribution, entanglement, and quantum network simulation.
# 
#  ## What is Quantum Networking?
# 
#  Quantum networking leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to create ultra-secure communication channels. Unlike classical networks that transmit bits (0s and 1s), quantum networks transmit quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in superposition states.
# 
#  ### Key Concepts:
#  - **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**: Secure key sharing using quantum mechanics
#  - **Quantum Entanglement**: Spooky action at a distance for instant correlation
#  - **BB84 Protocol**: A pioneering quantum cryptography protocol
#  - **Quantum Channels**: The medium for transmitting qubits
# 
#  ### Learning Objectives:
#  By the end of this notebook, you will:
#  1. Understand quantum networking fundamentals
#  2. Implement quantum protocols from scratch
#  3. Interact with a live quantum network simulation
#  4. Write your own quantum host implementations
#  5. Analyze quantum security and error rates
# 
#  Let's begin this quantum journey!

#  ## Section 1: Quantum Fundamentals
# 
#  Before diving into quantum networking, let's understand the basic building blocks:
# 
#  ### Qubits - The Quantum Bits
# 
#  A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information. Unlike classical bits that are either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a **superposition** of both states:
# 
#  $$|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$$
# 
#  Where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers called amplitudes, and $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$.
# 

# %% [markdown]
# [markdown]
# 
#  ##  Section 2: Understanding BB84 Protocol
# 
#  The BB84 protocol is a quantum key distribution protocol that allows two parties (Alice and Bob) to share a secret key using quantum mechanics.
# 
#  ### Key Steps:
#  1. **Alice** prepares qubits in random bases (Z or X)
#  2. **Alice** sends qubits to Bob through a quantum channel
#  3. **Bob** measures qubits in random bases
#  4. **Alice and Bob** publicly compare their basis choices
#  5. **Alice and Bob** keep only the bits where bases matched
#  6. **Alice and Bob** estimate error rate and perform privacy amplification
# 
#  Let's implement this step by step!

# %% [markdown]
# #  The B92 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol
# 
# 
# The **B92 protocol** is a simplified version of BB84, introduced by Charles Bennett in 1992.  
# Unlike BB84 which uses *four* states, B92 only uses **two non-orthogonal quantum states**.  
# 
# 
# - Alice sends qubits randomly chosen from two possible states (for example, `|0‚ü©` and `|+‚ü©`).  
# - Bob measures each qubit using one of two bases, but since the states are not orthogonal, he sometimes gets an **inconclusive result**.  
# - Only when Bob's measurement gives a *definite result* do Alice and Bob keep that bit.  
# 
# 
#  The key idea: by using non-orthogonal states, an eavesdropper (Eve) cannot perfectly distinguish them without disturbing the qubits  and that disturbance reveals her presence.
# 

# %% [markdown]
# #  Why B92 Works and What to Look for in the Logs
# 
# 
# In B92, **information is hidden in the fact that not all measurements succeed**:  
# 
# 
# - Bob keeps only the bits where his measurement result is *certain*.  
# - This means fewer key bits than BB84, but **more security checks** against eavesdropping.  
# 
# 
# When we run the simulation:
# - You‚Äôll see **Alice‚Äôs choices** of qubit states (randomly `|0‚ü©` or `|+‚ü©`).  
# - You‚Äôll see **Bob‚Äôs measurement results** some conclusive (bit values), some inconclusive (discarded).  
# - Finally, you‚Äôll notice that the **shared key** is formed only from the conclusive outcomes.  
# 
# 
#  Takeaway: The strength of B92 lies in the *impossibility of cloning non-orthogonal states*  making eavesdropping detectable
